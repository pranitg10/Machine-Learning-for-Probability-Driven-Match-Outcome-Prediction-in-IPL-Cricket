#IPL Match Outcome Prediction
##Objective
This project aims to predict the outcomes of IPL cricket matches using machine learning models. By analyzing in-game dynamics such as score progression, run rates, and wickets, the model estimates the probability of a team's victory during the match.

##Project Overview
###Data Collection: The dataset includes historical IPL match data, capturing details like scores, wickets, and match outcomes.
###Data Preprocessing: Standardized team and city names, handled special cases like the Duckworth-Lewis method, and engineered features such as runs left, balls left, current run rate, and required run rate.
###Modeling: Built a machine learning model to predict match outcomes based on the derived features, focusing on the probability of a team's victory.
###Evaluation: Assessed model performance in predicting match results, providing insights into key factors influencing match outcomes.
##Results
The model demonstrates [add performance metrics here] accuracy in predicting match outcomes, highlighting the significance of real-time game metrics in determining the result.
